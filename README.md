# Useful

If you can find a model with little dependencies, a good first integration test to write might be a test for updating a record.
Common integration tests:


1. Generate some test data
1. Log into the application
1. Visit the page I‚Äôm interested in
1. Perform whatever clicks and typing need to happen in order to exercise the feature I‚Äôm testing
1. Perform an *assertion*
